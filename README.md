INTRODUCTION:

The breakout board is a combo board that can be used with Teensy ver. 3.2 and 4.0 microcontroller module.

All pins and connectors are named on the board, easy! No need to look in the manual!

There is also a prototype area where you can add 2.54mm pitch components.

FEATURES:

•	Combo socket for the Teensy 3.2 or 4.0

•	On board connector for ESP 8266 WiFi module

•	Two CAN 2.0B and one CAN FD (One for Teensy 3.2)

•	Wide voltage input (7V to 28V DC)

•	I2C connector, with 5V and 3.3V supply output

•	Reverse supply voltage protection

•	Jumper selectable 120Ω terminator

•	2 of the analog inputs have ≈5V to ≈3.3V resistor divider (4.7k/12k)

•	2 of the digital inputs have ≈12V to ≈3.3V resistor divider (4.7k/1.2k)

ELECTRICAL SPESIFICATIONS:

•	Switch-mode DC/DC, 5V 500mA

•	LDO regulator, 3.3V 300mA

•	RTC CR2032 battery holder (battery not included)

•	Low side output; 7 X 500mA (or 3 X 500mA + 2 X 1A)

•	High side output; 4 X 2.6A 

•	High/Low side outputs can drive resistive, inductive and capacitive loads
